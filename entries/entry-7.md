<h1>Entry 7: Getting Closer To Striking My Goal</h1>
<h3>An Overview</h3>
  <p>During the seventh week of my Independent Study, it can be said that I have technically reached a "mvp", but not one that I would actually consider as an "mvp". I have created a game game where a user could knock over pin-like object with a ball. This was probably how bowling looked at the beginning when it was created, but I digress.</p>
<h3>Setbacks</h3>
  <p>I ahd to spend time trying to figure out how to create a short video of my work. I also had to figure out how to then add that video to my entry.</p>
  <h3>Having a Bowl</h3>
  <p>I am trying to make a bowling game. I can make a ball move, but can I make an object that mimics a bowling pin? This is what I set to find out. At first, I put created a cube and made it purple. This purple cube was supposed to help me find out what I need to do to create an object that mimics how a real bowling pin would move from a bowling a bowling ball. I try to move the sphere in the direction of the purple cube. However, the cube doesn't fall all the way back in hit by a ball. It only moves when the ball is touching it showing that this cube acted like a rock. I needed a way to make this cube lighter. While looking at the components of the cube, the one named "Rigidbody" allowed me to affect the object's de</p>
<h3>Plans for next week</h3>
  <p>What I plan on accomplishing by the end of week 8 is to have a more realistic bowling game by only allowing the user to aim and click the speed of the ball when rolling it instead of allowing them to move the ball anyway they want so anybody can get a strike.</p>
<h3>Lessons learned</h3>
  <p>A lesson I learned from week 7 is that </p>
