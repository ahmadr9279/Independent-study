<h1>Entry 6: Polishing My Skills And Beginning To Have A Bowl</h1>
<h3>An Overview</h3>
  <p>After doing many tutorials, watching youtube videos, learning some C#, and learning how to control a cube, it was finally time to create a product. After gaining the basic tools to create a game, my partner and I decided on making a bowling game. This week I was I began to create a bowling game and learned any skills needed on the way.</p>
<h3>Setbacks</h3>
  <p>For the first few days, the preview box where I could see how my game look was zoomed out and I couldn't see my game. I tried to zoom back in but it wouldn't work. It seemed that I still needed to learn how to properly use the view box where I could see my game. After googling ways to center the camera back to my game, I realized that I just needed to double click on any of the objects that I created in my script section. I double clicked on my cube and was automatically zoomed back to my game area. </p>
  <p>Before I could create a bowling game, I first needed to study the physics of Unity.</p>
<h3>Plans for next week</h3>
  <p>What I plan on accomplishing by the end of week 6 is to have a cube that fully moves throughout its enviornment by the arrow keys. I hope to accomplish my goal by continuing to watch the video I was talking about. If I complete this step and I still have time, I also hope to add other obstacles like balls which the cube could move around.</p>
<h3>Lessons learned</h3>
  <p>A lesson I learned from week 5 is that try to learn others things you didn't plan on learning about because they could add to how good your project might seem. For example, I wasn't planning on learning on how to change the color of my cube and find easier ways to use unity in creating objects, but they were all very cool things to learn and will ultimately contribute to my project.</p>
