<h2>Entry 5: My Journey To Finding What Makes Things Move</h2>

  <p>For the fifth week into our independent study, my main objective was to make a user capable of moving a cube with the arrow keys. At first, I thought it was going to be easy, so I tried to see if navigation was a add-on I can just click and drag onto my character. AFter many attempts, I looked back to one of the tutorials where I was able to move a character through the arrows (although I wasn't taught how to do that). After searching through the tutorial, I realized that the part that enabled the character to move was labeld "third character movement", and had the C# symbol. I realized that I have to learn a little C# to make my cube walk. I then did what any person would do in this situation... I searched "how to make a cube move in unity". </p>
  <p>At first, I clicked on a stack over flow link. However, this was very confusing, and was filled with a lot of complicated vocabulary realted to advanced Unity. I then tried plan b: I went on youtube and searched the same thing. I then found a video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXQI_0ILEW4". This video seemed very easy to understand, and I learned an easier way on how to create shapes, enviornments, and changing the color of things as well. I learned more than what I originally planned, and actually enjoyed it. However, I wasn't able to give my object movement yet because there wasn't enough time in class. But like I said before, I learned a lot of other small details that will ultimately make my game better.</p>
