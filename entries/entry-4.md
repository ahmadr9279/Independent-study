For the fourth week into our independent study, I finally got Unity to finish downloading on the laptop. Afterwards, I made an account and signed in. I then looked through the tutorials given. Throughout the week, I completed each of the five tutorials. All the tutorials were the same game, but the programmer had to do different things to learn different topics. Things needed to do ranged from learning about Unity's AI sysytem which is easy to integrate into a game, how to add ramps, how to change the speed of characters, and how to add physics like making objects affected by gravity. It turned out to be easier than expected, and the lesson I got from this is to try things that may seem hard because they might to turn out to be easy.
