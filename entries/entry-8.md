<h1>Entry 8: Looking At The Small Flaws & Patching Them Up</h1>
<h3>An Overview</h3>
  <p>I started my 8th week of Independent Study with an "mvp", and my goal was to polish this product and make it look better. After creating a simple game which shares characteristics with a bowling game, it was time to make it look more like one as much as I could.</p>
  <h3>Looking For Ways To Improve</h3>
  <p>My goal for week 8 was to make mmy game feel more like a bowling game, so what I had to do was look at the small things. Something that I noticed was the balls weren't lined up properly, and so I had to fix that. Another issue was that when the ball hit the pins, it would sometimes fall off the plane. I needed to add walls to the bowling game. These things might seem small, but they all add up in making a good game.</p>
<h3>Plans for next week</h3>
  <p>What I plan on accomplishing by the end of week 9 is to finish my project. The Independent Study is about to end, and I have to finish my project by the end of this week. I am just going to continue making edits to my game, and I already have an MVP.</p>
<h3>Lessons learned</h3>
  <p>A lesson I learned from week 8 is that small details ultimately add up, so don't think of them as any less compared to big details. For example, in my game, the small details I added to my bowling game ultimately added up to make my game look more realistic.</p>
