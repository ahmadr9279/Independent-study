For this week, I have spent class time watching videos to learn the basics of Unity, and trying to get to download on the laptop. For the first three days, I was watching how to make a unity game where basically a cube slides down a path, and it has to dodge obstacles. The link to the first part is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlKaB1etrik. However, on Thursday I borrowed a laptop from Mr. Mueller to use in class, and I started downloading Unity the same day. I waited the whole period on Thursday for Unity to finish downloading and I under-estimated how much space it would take up. Each time I thought Unity was finished downloading, there was another "part" that needed to be downloaded. Unity didn't finish downloading on Thursday, but I had to shut down the laptop because the bell rang. The next day, I openend the laptop and found out that now I have to download Unity from the beginning again. Fortuantely, it finished downloading on Friday, but there were only a few minutes left in the period and I couldn't tinker. However, I was continuing to watch the videos on how to code the Unity game I talked about before, and it was very interesting how the physics and motion were added. My takeaway is to work hard on your project at the very beginning because the beginning lays the foundation for everything else. If I had borrowed a laptop during Monday, I would have an had time to tinker.
