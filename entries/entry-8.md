<h1>Entry 7: Getting Closer To Striking My Goal</h1>
<h3>An Overview</h3>
  <p>During the seventh week of my Independent Study, it can be said that I have technically reached a "mvp", however this is the bare minimuim and it still needs work to look presentable. I have created a game where a user could knock over pin-like objects with a ball. This was probably how bowling looked like at the beginning when it was created, but I digress.</p>
<h3>Educational Setbacks</h3>
  <p>A major setback that I had was just working on strengthening my evidence of learning. I have included pictures, but now I want to include a video so you could see my game in action. I had to spend time trying to figure out how to create a short video of my work. After googling for a few minutes and then asking my partner, I used an application found on recordit.co. I also had to figure out how to then add that video to my entry. That meant that I had to connect the laptop to my email and then email myself the video. After that, I created a folder in my Independent Study Project called "Images". To add my video, I needed to download it on my laptop and then drag it to the "Images" folder in c9. Although I had less time to work on my project, what I learned will help me make better blog entries.</p>
  <h3>Having a Bowl</h3>
  <p>I am trying to make a bowling game. I can make a ball move, but can I make an object that mimics a bowling pin? This is what I set to find out. At first, I put created a cube and made it purple. This purple cube was supposed to help me find out what I need to do to create an object</p>
<h3>Plans for next week</h3>
  <p>What I plan on accomplishing by the end of week 8 is to have a more realistic bowling game by only allowing the user to aim and click the speed of the ball to roll it instead of allowing them to move the ball anytime they want which would allow them to easily get a strike.</p>
<h3>Lessons learned</h3>
  <p>A lesson I learned from week 7 is that </p>
