<h1>Entry 6: Polishing My Skills And Beginning To Have A Bowl</h1>
<h3>An Overview</h3>
  <p>After doing many tutorials, watching youtube videos, learning some C#, and learning how to control a cube, it was finally time to create a product. After gaining the basic tools to create a game, my partner and I decided on making a bowling game. This week I began to make a bowling game and learned any skills neccessary like physics.</p>
<h3>Setbacks</h3>
  <p>For the first few days, the preview box where I could see how my game looks was zoomed out and I couldn't see my game. I tried to zoom back in but it wouldn't work. It seemed that I still needed to learn how to properly use the view box where I could see my game. After googling ways to center the camera back to my game, I realized that I just needed to double click on any of the objects that I created in my script section. I double clicked on my cube and was automatically zoomed back to my game area. This issue ultimately took up one work day since I tried to solve it on my own for a few minutes.</p>
  <h3>Studying Physics While Coding</h3>
  <p>I am trying to make a bowling game. I can make a ball move, but can I make an object that mimics a bowling pin? This is what I set to find out. At first, I put created a cube and made it purple. This purple cube was supposed to help me find out what I need to do to create an object that mimics how a real bowling pin would move from a bowling a bowling ball. I try to move the sphere in the direction of the purple cube. However, the cube doesn't fall all the way back in hit by a ball. It only moves when the ball is touching it showing that this cube acted like a rock. I needed a way to make this cube lighter. While looking at the components of the cube, the one named "Rigidbody" allowed me to affect the objects density.</p>
<h3>Plans for next week</h3>
  <p>What I plan on accomplishing by the end of week 7 is to have an mvp for my bowling game, where the objects successfuly mimic a bowling ball and bowling pin.</p>
<h3>Lessons learned</h3>
  <p>A lesson I learned from week 6 is that after you think your finished learning and ready to build, be ready to lerarn some more. I didn't think about the physics of the game until after I finished learning how to make objects move. While learning how to make objects move, I thought I would be ready afterwards to craete a game. However, when it was time to actually make the game and trying to knock down a cube, it seemed that I needed to learn more</p>
